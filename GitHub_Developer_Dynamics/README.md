## GitHub Developer Dynamics: Analyzing Token Price Correlations

This data challenge explores the relationship between GitHub developer activity and token prices in cryptocurrency projects: Ocean Protocol, Bittensor, Fetch.AI, Numerai and SingularityNET. Participants analyze metrics like commits and repository creation to uncover correlations with token price fluctuations. The challenge also evaluates whether developer engagement reflects project success.


## Exploring Developer Activity and Token Prices in Crypto-AI Projects
We are excited to invite data enthusiasts, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts to participate in a comprehensive data challenge. This challenge is designed to provide practical insights into the dynamics between developer activity and token prices across five leading crypto-AI projects: Ocean Protocol, Bittensor, Fetch.AI, Numerai and SingularityNET.

## Challenge Overview
Participants will utilize GitHub, the premier development collaboration and code management platform, to access extensive datasets encompassing repositories, commits, and the historical price movements of each project's tokens. This data will serve as the backbone of our analysis.

## Objectives
Correlation Analysis: Determine the correlation between the volume and frequency of commits in a project's repository and the fluctuations in its token price.
Temporal Analysis: Examine how developer activity aligns with significant price events, such as peaks, troughs, and periods of high volatility.
Tools and Technologies
While GitHub will be our primary data source and collaboration tool, participants are encouraged to manipulate and analyze the data using various analytical tools and programming languages.

## Outcomes
The goal is to understand better how developer activities influence market perceptions and financial metrics within the crypto space. Participants will produce insights that could guide investors, developers, and project managers in making informed decisions about their engagements in crypto projects.

## Participation
This challenge is open to anyone interested in data analysis, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. Whether you are a seasoned data scientist, a student, or a crypto enthusiast looking to delve into data analytics, we welcome your contributions.
